After turning off or moving the taskbar, you suddenly find that the logo in the corner of the screen and the search magnifier are still visible on your monitor or TV screen, although not as brightly.

This is called "image retention" or "burn-in".

Burnfix can attempt to get rid of this effect on your LCD, LED or plasma screen by showing a special moving pattern for a perioid of time.

Moreover, burnfix can show full-screen images of various colors to help you identify defects in the display matrix.
