Neptune is a virtual application that produces a sound upon key activation, resembling a physical mechanical keyboard. Unlike its real-life counterpart, Neptune spares you from disturbing those nearby. It bears a striking resemblance to mechvibes, but with notable advantages: superior speed, being coded in Go instead of JavaScript and Electron, thus eliminating excessive RAM and CPU consumption.
