Use Pixyne to quickly review your photo folder and safely delete bad and similar shots.

The application has a simple and intuitive interface. With one click you can drop a photo to trash.
You may also set or correct the EXIF shooting date to the file date or to a manually entered date.
When you save changes, you can change all file names to EXIF shooting date.
