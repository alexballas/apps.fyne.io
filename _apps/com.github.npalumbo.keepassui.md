I noticed that some of the commercial password managers don't support desktop and mobile versions at the same time on their free versions. We can solve that problem using Keepass.

Additionally, Keepass has many ports, many of them to specific target platforms like Mac or Android. I thought it was interesting to explore writing a Keepass UI that can be released on many platforms from the same codebase!.
