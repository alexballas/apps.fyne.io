Secure your communications.
When it matters.
It matters NOW!

Public infrastructure is compromised. Back doors are real, your data is at risk to prying eyes, even though it says it is secure. Mail servers do not store encrypted mail messages. Only the transport layer IE: https:// is encrypted but your message is stored clear text. If they ask for you to create an encryption key set, it means they can decrypt your mail.

Use this transparent software to ensure private communications.

If you have a key-logger installed on your device, your screwed, but other than that, your communications are safe.

Use a private server for storing and distributing encrypted messages or just encrypt some text for use in email and other applications.

Use our server for testing and move to your own server.

Take complete control over your privacy. It's a little harder than social media posts, but your message is private. Social media can be used by using the Enc/Dec to encrypt the message with you private password.
