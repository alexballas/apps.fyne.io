category:  utility

Forage simplifies interacting with shopping lists on your Mealie instance. It runs on Linux, Android, Darwin, Windows, iOS, and FreeBSD (builds are provided for the first four), and presents a native Fyne alternative to the Mealie web interface. You can create shopping lists, add items, and toggle items' checked status.

With the release of v1, Forage can work entirely in offline mode without a server. Without a server, it functions as a non-connected shopping list app, albeit currently limited in editing.
